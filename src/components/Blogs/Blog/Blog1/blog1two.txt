I realize that I am ruining a great word here. I'm sorry. So, I have taken the liberty of assembling some guidelines for complimenting the women in your life on social media:

1. Use adjectives that are *gasp* actually related to the accomplishment or milestone that you are celebrating. Don't pass out. It's ok. I'll help with some ideas:

Did she just run a marathon? speedy, sweaty, pants-pooping, committed, athletic

Did she just graduate? accomplished, hard-working, knowledgeable

Did she just turn some random insignificant age? .........like....why do need an adjective? Just say Happy Birthday.

Is it your mom on Mother's Day? Call her.

Did you just marry her? Put your phone down.

Did she just win a body building competition? OK! Now you may use “strong”!!!
