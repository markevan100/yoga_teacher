2. Maybe don't use an adjective. Yeah, I know, this feels like a trap, cuz we just talked about all the adjectives. Here's the thing... Most social media posts are using adjectives in their superlative form: "to the sweetest sister out there," "the most badass friend in the world," "the most caring woman I know," "the best mom EVER." Let's use this last one to see why superlatives are problematic. Have you ever noticed that somehow ALL of your friends have the best mom ever? How is that possible? Maybe moms are just tight? And... if generally the idea of moms is great, whose world are you rocking by declaring that? Only people whose moms are NOT great, not living, not existent, missing etc. What an asshole. You are an asshole.

Does this mean we shouldn't celebrate good things? NO. It means you should celebrate good things in a way that is beautiful and fun between you and the person you are celebrating, and leave comparative (superlative) adjectives out of it. You can highlight how the person makes you feel since posting on your social media is probably for you to begin with.

Engagement: "Spending time with you makes me so happy!" (although... this one is silly cuz, ha! you're actually NOT spending time with them while you're posting this)

Birthday: "I'm glad you were born" (So glad in fact, that I can't say it to your face? I guess this one needs work, too)

Mother's Day: "Thanks for all the times you wiped my poopy butt and made me sandwiches" (Well, shit. We've been through the trouble with Mother's Day already...)
